Most chapters contain numbered steps.</p> <p>Throughout the guide, images are used as examples of the IBM Cloud Portal, IBM Cloud Shell, and PowerVS instance consoles.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>The IBM Cloud Portal and IBM Power Virtual Server changes regularly and can differ from the images that are captured here.</p> <p>In most images, the following styles of highlighting are used:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Action highlight box: illustrates where to click, enter, or select an item:</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Numbered action highlight box: illustrates where to click, enter, or select items and the order in which they should be processed:</p> <p> </p> <p>Conflict with current Sales Enablement Center of Excellence (COE)</p> <p>The COE states \"Circled uppercase letters are used as image callouts to show where to perform the action and the same letter is shown in bold in the instructions.\"</p> <p>This should be revisited.</p> <ol> <li>If doing numbered step-by-step instructions, a number should be used to correspond with the step. </li> <li>If depicting sub-steps that are lettered, then a letter should be used to aligns with the instructions - either capital or lower case.</li> </ol> <p>The COE is a little inconsistent as it first says to use red and then says to use contrasting color for labels. For consistency, it should be contrasting color from the screen capture. In my opinion, this actually should not be red, especially when signalling an action that should be performed. Red is the universal color for stop which makes is use counter intuitive.</p> <p>COE also calls out using specific thickness (2.25 points) and size (0.91cm circle) of highlights and numbers. This should probably be more flexible and based upon the resolution of the image and what needs to be highlighted. The above sizes may have been specified given a specific font size. On-line directions need more flexibility.</p> <p>COE also says to use a circle for numbered circles. Would suggest using a shape (like shown above) that provides more positional direction especially when there is a need to avoid covering certain aspects of the UI.</p> <p>The COE also appears to say every action should be highlighted with a numbered circle. I believe this should be optional and the numbered circles should be added \"where needed for clarity\", for example a form with multiple entry fields to explain each field. A single \"Click OK\" should not require a highlight box and a circle with a 1.</p> </li> <li> <p>Explore more highlight box: illustrates one of two things:</p> <ul> <li>the path to follow to get to a specific location in the user interface</li> <li>areas to explore</li> </ul> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Copy to the clipboard box: The text is copied to the clipboard.

For example, entering Ctrl+v, Cmd+v, or right click and select paste.</p> <p></p> <p>Conflict with current Sales Enablement Center of Excellence (COE)</p> <p>COE specifies \"No inline icons are used in the text because they do not show th context and location.\" </p> <p>I believe that is only one use case where in-line icons can be used. I believe they can be quite effective as shown in the paragraph for copy keyboard shortcut. It is also useful to identify elements of a UI elements that are small. When doing so, they should also be highlighted in the image as well. The IBM Style guide supports this as well.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Several \"click through\" demonstrations are included.
